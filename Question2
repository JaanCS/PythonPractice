#Question2
#Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user
#If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message
#Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message

num = int(input("Give me a number: "))
check = int(input("Give me another number: "))

if num%2 ==0: print("Your number is an even number")
... else: print("Your number is an odd number")

if num%4 ==0: print("Your number is a multiple of four")
... elif num%2 ==0: print("Your number is an even number")
... else: print("Your number is an odd number")

if num%check ==0: print(str(num) + " is divisible by " + str(check))
... else: print(str(num) + " is not divisible by " + str(check))
