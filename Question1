#Question1
#Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.
#Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message
#Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines.

Name = input("Tell me your name: ")
Age = int(input("How old are you: "))
Hundred = Name + ", you will be a hundred years old in the year " + str(2118 - Age)
print(Hundred)
num = int(input("Give me a random number between 1 and 10: "))
repeat = num * Hundred
print(repeat)
repeat2 = num * ("\n" + Hundred)
print(repeat2)
